# Minesweeper Game


![Minesweeper]()

---
## The Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python and the `pygame` library.
The game is played on a grid where the player must avoid hidden mines while uncovering cells to reveal their contents.

Interesting; isn't it!

---
## General Features

- Interactive graphical user interface.
- Left-click to reveal cells and right-click to flag potential mines.
- `Random`ly generated mines to create a unique game experience each time.
- `Win` the game by successfully uncovering `all non-mine cells`.
- `Lose` the game `if you reveal a mine cell.`


---
## General Prerequisites To this program

- `Python3` is used in this (let me say python 3.x). ~ Smiles
- `pygame` library (install using `pip install pygame`) ~ necessary installations.


---
## How to Play (This section will be updated as the program get to completion)

The basics as research projects:::

1. Upon completion of this project, Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required `pygame` library by running `pip install pygame`.
4. Run the game by executing the `minesweeper.py` file.


---
## Controls (Any update will be made if any but these will be the basic keys)

- Left-click: Reveal a cell.
- Right-click: Flag or unflag a cell as a potential mine.

## General Concepts (python3 - Updates will be made as they are implemented)

To implement the Minesweeper game in Python3.

In my research, The various programming concepts and libraries necessary to implement this program is as follows::

1. Basic Python Programming:

	- Variables, data types, and operators
	- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
	- Loops (for and while)
	- Lists and 2D lists (for the game grid)
	- Functions and function calls
	- Recursion (for revealing adjacent cells)
	- Input and output (input, print)

<em>Aside Recursion in python, all of the above have been discussed with a team including myself</em>

The team include:
	
	- Yasir Musa <@baydre>
	- Lawal Tajudeen Ogunsola <@lawalTheWest>
	- Isa Sulaiman Isa <@wireless1234>
	- Joseph Abang <null>
	- Tanyaradzwa Chiramba <@tannyaarr>
	- <null>

2. Data Structures: (Discussed)
	- Lists: To represent the game board and revealed cells
	- Dictionaries: For storing cell contents (mines, numbers)

3. Functions and Methods: (discussed)
	- Creating functions to encapsulate different parts of the game logic
	- Modularizing your code for better organization and reusability

4. Recursion:
	- Implementing recursive functions to reveal empty cells and adjacent cells

5. User Interface:
	- Using the `pygame` library to create a graphical user interface
	- Displaying the game board using rectangles, images, and text
	- Handling user input (mouse clicks)

6. Algorithm Design: (Algorith has been written)
	- Designing algorithms for initializing the game,
	- handling cell selections, and
	- checking win/loss conditions

7. Logic and Control Flow:
	- Using if statements and loops to control game logic and flow
	- Determining when the game is over and how to handle different outcomes

8. Randomization:
	- Using the `random` module to place mines randomly on the grid

9. Error Handling:
	- Dealing with edge cases and handling errors gracefully

10. Version Control (Optional):
	- Using Git for version control to manage your code changes and collaborate with others

11. Documentation:
	- Adding comments to your code for clarity
	- Writing a README.md file to explain how to run the game and provide an overview of the project

12. Debugging:
	- Learning how to debug your code to identify and fix issues

13. Practice and Experimentation:
	- Experimenting with smaller coding challenges and projects before tackling the full game
	- Iterating and refining your code as you go

Learning to implement a game like Minesweeper is a great way to enhance my programming skills, as it involves a combination of different concepts and problem-solving skills.
Taking it step by step and refering to documentation, and with the help of discussions with my team.


#learning through hands-on experience.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by the classic Minesweeper game.
- The implementation is based on my understanding of game logic and the `pygame` library.
- Any improvements to this program from anyone will be appreciated.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a timer to track the time taken to complete the game.
- Adding different difficulty levels with varying grid sizes and mine counts.
- Improving the user interface by adding icons and animations.
- Enhancing error handling and edge case scenarios.
