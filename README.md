# Minesweeper Game

![Minesweeper]()

## The Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python and the `pygame` library.
The game is played on a grid where the player must avoid hidden mines while uncovering cells to reveal their contents.

Interesting; isn't it!

## General Features

- Interactive graphical user interface.
- Left-click to reveal cells and right-click to flag potential mines.
- `Random`ly generated mines to create a unique game experience each time.
- `Win` the game by successfully uncovering `all non-mine cells`.
- `Lose` the game `if you reveal a mine cell.`


## General Prerequisites To this program

- `Python3` is used in this (let me say python 3.x). ~ Smiles
- `pygame` library (install using `pip install pygame`) ~ necessary installations.


## How to Play (This section will be updated as the program get to completion)

The basics as research projects:::

1. Upon completion of this project, Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required `pygame` library by running `pip install pygame`.
4. Run the game by executing the `minesweeper.py` file.


## Controls (Any update will be made if any but these will be the basic keys)

- Left-click: Reveal a cell.
- Right-click: Flag or unflag a cell as a potential mine.

## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by the classic Minesweeper game.
- The implementation is based on my understanding of game logic and the `pygame` library.
- Any improvements to this program from anyone will be appreciated.


## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a timer to track the time taken to complete the game.
- Adding different difficulty levels with varying grid sizes and mine counts.
- Improving the user interface by adding icons and animations.
- Enhancing error handling and edge case scenarios.
